# pac man the game

A Pac-Man game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a classic recreation of the iconic arcade game where players control Pac-Man, a yellow circular character, navigating through a maze, eating dots, avoiding ghosts, and collecting fruits for points. Here's a breakdown of how such this game is structured:<br><br>

    => HTML Structure:
        -> The HTML structure will consist of the game board where Pac-Man moves, the maze layout, the score display, and any other necessary elements.

    => CSS Styling:
        -> CSS will be used to style the game elements, including the maze, Pac-Man, ghosts, score display, etc.

    => JavaScript Logic:
        -> JavaScript will handle the game's logic, including Pac-Man movement, ghost behavior, collision detection, scoring, and game over conditions.
        -> It will also handle user input (keyboard controls) to move Pac-Man through the maze.
        -> Collision detection algorithms will be implemented to determine when Pac-Man eats dots, fruits, or encounters ghosts.

    => Game Mechanics:
        -> Pac-Man moves through a maze, eating dots and fruits for points.
        -> Ghosts roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If Pac-Man collides with a ghost, he loses a life.
        -> Power pellets can be consumed by Pac-Man, allowing him to temporarily turn the tables and chase ghosts, which can be eaten for extra points.

    => Scorekeeping:
        -> The game will keep track of the player's score, updating it as Pac-Man eats dots, fruits, and ghosts.

    => Game Over and Restart:
        -> When Pac-Man loses lives, the game ends, displaying the final score and offering the option to restart.

Creating a Pac-Man game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be a fun and educational project, offering opportunities to learn about game development, algorithms, and user interaction. There are also many tutorials and resources available online to guide developers through the process.
